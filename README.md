# Titanium CLI

---
## *Modified from Appcelerator Titanium CLI to update dependencies and apply security patches.*

---


> [Titanium CLI](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium) is a
[Command Line Tool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)
for creating and building Titanium Mobile applications and modules. It's
open-source and easy to use. [We've](https://github.com/appcelerator)
designed Titanium to be suitable for command line beginners, but still be
powerful and extensible enough for production usage.

[![@titanium/titanium](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@titanium/titanium.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@titanium/titanium)
[![@titanium/titanium](https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/@titanium/titanium/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/@titanium/titanium)

## Prerequisites

The Titanium CLI requires [Node.js 0.10.x](http://nodejs.org/dist/) or newer.

## Installation

    [sudo] npm install -g titanium

## Bleeding Edge

You can download the latest and greatest *unstable* Titanium CLI code by
running the following:

    [sudo] npm install -g git://github.com/appcelerator/titanium.git

## Obtaining a Titanium SDK

You will need to download a Titanium SDK 3.0 or newer:

    # stable release (recommended)
    titanium sdk install --default

There are times when the latest stable release has an issue or lacks a feature
in which case you may want to try an unstable Titanium SDK build. These builds
are not recommended for production use, but should work for development.

    # unstable next release
    titanium sdk install --branch 3_1_X --default

    # bleeding edge
    titanium sdk install --branch master --default

## Setting up the Titanium CLI

Before you begin using the Titanium CLI, you should configure it by running the
"setup" command:

    titanium setup

It will prompt you with a number of questions such as your e-mail address (for
logging into the Appcelerator Network), the location of your Android SDK, and so on.

## Usage

    titanium <command> [options]

## Built-in Commands

### config

Configure your CLI settings.

**Implementation not complete**

    titanium config <setting> <value>

### help

Displays help or help for a specific command.

    titanium

    titanium help

    titanium --help

    titanium help <command>

    titanium <command> --help

### login

Logs into the Appcelerator Network

**Implementation not complete**

Login requires both user and password options to be passed in.

    titanium login <username> <password>

If you omit an option, the CLI will prompt you for the value.

    titanium login

### logout

Logs out of the Appcelerator Network

**Implementation not complete**

    titanium logout

### sdk

Download and install Titanium SDKs

#### sdk install

Installs a specific version of the Titanium SDK. If no version is specified, it assumes the latest.

    titanium sdk install

    titanium sdk install <version>

    titanium sdk install <version> --force

Download, install <version>, and set as default SDK.

    titanium sdk install <version> --default

Download and install the latest version for the specified branch

    titanium sdk install --branch master

#### sdk uninstall

Uninstalls a Titanium SDK.

    titanium sdk uninstall <version>

#### sdk list

Lists all installed Titanium SDKs. Optionally lists all branches and releases.

    titanium sdk list

    titanium sdk list -b
    titanium sdk list --branches

    titanium sdk list -r
    titanium sdk list --releases

    titanium sdk list -br
    titanium sdk list --branches --releases

### setup

Reconfigures the Titanium CLI by asking you a series of questions.

    titanium setup

### status

Indicates whether you are logged in or not.

    titanium status

    titanium status --output json

### version

Displays the current version of the CLI and exits.

    titanium -v

    titanium --version

### info

Displays information about your development environment including Xcode installs,
iOS SDKs, Android SDKs, and so on.

    titanium info

    titanium info -o json

## Hacking the Titanium CLI

In order to begin hacking on the Titanium CLI, you need to download and install
[git](http://git-scm.com/).

If you have already installed a previous version of the Titanium CLI, it's
recommended you uninstall the old one first:

    [sudo] npm uninstall -g titanium

The Titanium CLI is essentially pure JavaScript, so there is no build process.
You just need to pull the code and resolve the dependendencies.

    git clone git@github.com:appcelerator/titanium.git
    cd titanium
    npm install
    sudo npm link

### Running Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, simply run:

    node forge test

### Running Code Coverage

To generate the code coverage, you first must install
[node-jscoverage](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage). The easist
way to do this is run:

    git clone git@github.com:visionmedia/node-jscoverage.git
    cd node-jscoverage
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

Then run:

	node forge test-cov

It will generate a file called _coverage.html_ in the Titanium CLI directory.

## Looking for the really old CLI?

Don't worry, it's still around. You can install it by running:

    [sudo] npm install â€“g titanium@0.0.26
